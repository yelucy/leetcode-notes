Each jupyter notebook contains one category of data structures/algorithms (i.e. Arrays, Queues, BST, etc.). 

Structure:
1. Problem description
2. Code (notes are in comments)
3. Run through test case 
   
For faster page loading and review, each jupyter notebook (.ipynb) will have its corresponding markdown (.md) file to view. 
   
SQL problems and solutions are available in the .sql file(s). Ignore the Jupyter Notebook version as that is no longer updated (ipython-sql or SQLite doesn't have the if functionality so MySQL was used instead).   
   
Structure:   
1. Problem description   
2. Schema (the code to create the test case)   
3. Code
