# leetcode-notes
Each jupyter notebook contains one category of data structures/algorithms (i.e. Arrays, Queues, BST, etc.). 

Structure:
1. Problem description
2. code (notes are in comments)
3. run through test case 
   
For faster page loading and review, each jupyter notebook (.ipynb) will have its corresponding markdown (.md) file to view.
